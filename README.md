# Codam_Core

I decided to pursue Codam Core in my limited time in the Netherlands. This repo contains all the projects I have completed and work-in-progress.

It's a self-paced, peer-to-peer learning school that will allow me to acquire coding knowledge and skills roughly equivalent to a bachelor degree.

There are a total of 7 ranks of projects to complete before graduation. As you successfully complete projects, you will rank up to the next one. The project folders here begin with their rank number. 6 is the final rank.

Anticipated Completion Date: Before 2023-05-31
